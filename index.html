          I've recently enrolled in Bloc's Web Developer Bootcamp. During the program I have had the opportunity to create web pages from scratch.
I love how something can go from an idea to a live and functioning webpage. Since I was young I enjoyed being able to create. Through web development
I'm able to create websites that many can visit and enjoy. I appreciate all the processes involved and how some aspects can be dependent on another to function properly.

When I'm not learning to code I enjoy landscape photography and hiking around the many mountains my city has to offer. I enjoy new activities where I can learn something new or challenge myself.
